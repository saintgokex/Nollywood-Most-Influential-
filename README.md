# Nollywood-Most-Influential-Actor

## Factors
To deermine the most influential Nollywood, we need to consider a wide range of factors viz: 
- longevity
- net worth
- social media following
- box office revenue
- major awards won

### Longevity

Being successful in the industry for two or three consecutive years is not enough to earn the title of “The One” of Nollywood. It’s important to find out the actors with the most longevity in the industry.

## Who are the real ballers among our Nollywood stars?
Staying relevant in the industry for decades can’t be the sole determinant of the most influential Nollywood actor, we need to weigh the wallets and see who’s got the fattest one.

Out of all the 82 actors under review, only two have a networth of over USD 10 million.

Only four of the 82 actors under review have over 10m followers on Instagram while just One of them crossed the 15m mark.


## Who is Nigerian Box Office’s Number One? 

Nigeria box Office has generated a cumulative revenue of 19 billion naira over the past three years, our analysis won't be fair if we don't assess who the top earners are among our Nollywood stars.
